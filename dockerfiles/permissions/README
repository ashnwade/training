This creates the base gravwell image that has ONLY the indexer, webserver, and search agent.

We also create a user and group with UID/GID 1000/1000 named gravwell/gravwell.
Each component should have the appropriate user and group permissions

We dont' have a crash reporter or ingester, or gencert.  Its designed to be extremely small

The gravwell.conf file only has a default well
