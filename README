# Pre-reqs:

	apt-get install texlive-* latexmk

You'll want the shell installers for simple relay, file follow, netflow capture, and federator in /tmp before building the containers.

# Building

To build just the PDF:

	make master.pdf

To build the whole tarball with docker images and all:

	VERSION=5.3.0 LICENSE=/path/to/gravwell-license make dist


NOTE: You will need a training license in order to build the complete set of containers.
